## Project Description
Risk (Soldier & Dice) is a classics in Board Game industry and is still popular today. In this simulation work, we chose to omit the aspects of territory control and troop movement, and only focus on the tactical combat, which is the core of the game.

## Rules
The simplified Risk game applies a dice-driven combat system. The human player will be asked to choose his troop size and the robot player will automatically have the same size of army. Each unit is represented by a dice. A typical round of the combat is like this: after rolling all the dice, the two players compare their highest dice roll, then the second highest one, and so on. The unit with a lower dice value is eliminated (in case of being equal, the attacker's unit is eliminated). The players continue combatting for infinite rounds until all units of one player are eliminated, which signifies the victory of his adversary.

## Organization
Our team organized our work through the Jira Software. We first shared resources and to do issues on the platform, which allowed us to be more familiar with the game machanism and to better distribute the tasks. After a short period of divised work, we got together to discuss our current state and the problem at stake. Jira facilitated us to share our on-going work with the other team members. It also made it possible for us to access the ever-developing codes and participate in the revision job. Finally, thanks to Jira, we make the preparation of the presentation much easier.

What does your repository look like? Explain your folder and file structure.
Our repository called ***Ironhack_GitHub*** which contains a folder called **Project No.1**. That folder has 6 files where you can find everything related about the said project. <br>
Each file is organize by it's **parent name** (*Project No.*), followed by the **project's name**, and finally the **kind of file**. Here are the complete list of our deliverables:
1. README file for GitHub readers (guide and overview)
2. JIRA Kanban board screenshot
3. PDF document defining the project plan
4. PNG file for the game's algorithm (flowchart)
5. Pseudocode and Python code for the game simulator
6. Presentation (slides)
